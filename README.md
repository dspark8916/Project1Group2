    Spice It Up!!! 

# Project Description

    Slogan: Need some spice in your life??? With our project we have decided to make an app that will help the user fight boredom. The app will provide the user with suggestions on activities they can do from a number of categories. The categories will include DIY activities, relaxation activities, social activities, educational activities, busywork, cooking activities, recreational activities, charitable activities, and music suggestions for you to listen to. We will create a random activity generator that will sort through all the activities from all the categories combined. We will also create separate generator for each category individually so that if the user already has a certain idea of what they want to do they can chose the specific category and be given a random activity from there. We will also incorporate a quotes api to generate a random quote of the day with each activity as well as a weather api to show the user the local forecast for the day.
